# WeatherApp

Weather is the state of the atmosphere, describing for example the degree to which it is hot or cold, wet or dry, calm or stormy, clear or cloudy. Weather is driven by air pressure, temperature and moisture differences between one place and another.

# Using the Weather API

This site will allow us to get the actual weather for any cities that we add in our app.

  * Go to the site https://openweathermap.org/api, create an account and then go to the API keys on their dashboard. Enter a name and generate a new API key. This key will allow us to use the API to get the weather.
